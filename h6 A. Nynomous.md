# Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

> https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor

1. Tor remains effective in providing anonymity, despite NSA efforts to compromise it. Of course specific Tor users have been compromised but this is due to browser exploits or misconfigurations but the cryptographic integrity of Tor itself seems intact. 

2. Tor is not exclusively used by criminals. Activists use it to bypass censorship and protect their identities, the military uses it for secure communication, and families use it for online safety.

   => Tor can actually help protect against tactics like identity theft and online stalking, rather than aiding criminals.

3. Despite its initial funding from the US Navy, Tor does not have a military backdoor. Multiple security experts have audited the code, confirming its integrity. 

4. Running a relay is generally not considered illegal under US law, though it may attract law enforcement attention.

5. Tor is user-friendly, with the Tor Browser Bundle offering a pre-configured, secure browsing experience. 

6. While Tor is slower than regular internet connections, ongoing efforts by Tor developers have made the network faster than before. Expanding the network with more relays is a key factor in increasing its speed.

7. Tor is not foolproof, and user mistakes can compromise anonymity. To maintain security, it's crucial to use the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails, keep software updated, and be cautious about logging into services like Google or Facebook over Tor.

## Introduction

1. The Tor Browser is based on Firefox and is a significant tool for anonymous internet use. It conceals the user's IP address, making it extremely challenging to trace or identify them without specialized techniques.

2. Tor is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in providing anonymity. Users don't need any technical expertise, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. 

## History and Intended Use of The Onion Router

1. Tor is designed to enable unrestricted and anonymous online communication like bypassing government censorship and providing a secure channel for private business communications. However, like any tool, it can be used for both legitimate and criminal activities.
2. While initially developed by the US government, Tor is no longer under its control and is open for improvement by anyone with the technical expertise.  Ironically, the US government, which created Tor, is also researching ways to de-anonymize its users.

## How The Onion Router Works

1. Tor guides your internet traffic through random stops (relays) on the web.

2. It adds layers of unbreakable encryption, like sealing an envelope multiple times.

3. At each relay (entry, middle, exit), one layer of encryption is peeled off, and the data moves forward.

4. The final relay (exit) connects to your desired website without encryption.

5. Tor constantly changes relays every 10 minutes, making tracking difficult.

6. Think of it like sending a letter through friends, each peeling off one envelope layer.

7. This process ensures that no one relay knows both the origin and destination of your data.

8. Tor can sometimes route suspicious traffic, like in a case where an exit node operator was wrongly investigated for child pornography.

## Tracking Criminals Using TOR

1. Tracking users of Tor, which offers online anonymity, is challenging. But many governments want to deanonymize Tor for various reasons, like catching criminals or limiting internet access.
2. Although some successes in deanonymizing Tor users have been reported, most were due to suspects' mistakes rather than breaking Tor's security.
3. The FBI once took down a child pornography site on Tor by infecting the servers, which, in turn, infected Tor browsers used to access those sites. They captured IP addresses until the exploit was patched.
4. Tor's main weakness is its users. Customizing Tor is discouraged, as even small changes can leak information. For instance, allowing geolocation or certain scripts can reveal your IP.
5. The main goal in most investigations is to obtain the user's true IP address, which Tor makes challenging.
6. In some cases, investigators may have access to one end of the communication, such as a victim. They can use tracking codes in emails or documents to potentially reveal the suspect's IP address.

# Install TOR browser and access TOR network

## 1. Open your virtual machine

## 2. Go to your web browser and download TOR

## 7. You have now access to the TOR browser

<img width="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/piafernandez/h6-A.-Nynomous/assets/71267247/edd7260d-1d64-4fe9-b7f1-d442a9e530c8">

## 8. Access to TOR network

1.  I searched "list of onion adresses"

2. Then I picked the https://darkweburls.com  

3. Here you can find some onion links with a directory of other onion links/sites

   <img width="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/piafernandez/h6-A.-Nynomous/assets/71267247/aee28027-5544-42b2-946b-8a511a592023">

# Browse TOR network

## 1. Search engine for onion sites

```
I have searched for a search engine for onion sites and the first one I found is Ahmia.fi, which is designe to allow access to the dark web.
```

## 2. Marketplace

```
For this one, I have simply search "Marketplace" in ahmia.fi 

And I click on the PremiumCardz where you can buy credit cards.

For example, you can buy a Mastercard Gold with a 2'500 euros limit for around 600 euros
```

## 3. Forum

```
For this one, I have also simply search "Forum" in ahmia.fi 

And I click on the Cards Forum, which is about bank type cards.
```

## 4. A site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

```
For this task, as seen in class, I will search the onion site for the CIA.

Of course, it was easier fot me to use Ahmia.fi and just searched CIA.
```
